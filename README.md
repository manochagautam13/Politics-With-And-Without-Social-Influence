# Politics-With-And-Without-Social-Influence
Have you ever wondered how would be our world without social networks and its influence? That is what we have tried to simulate here.
We tried to simulate both the real world politics as well as a hypothetical world.
In the hypothetical world other people's decisions do not have any influence on other's decisions leading to the winning party to be the one that works for the welfare of people and not the one that put their feet in the world of politics before others, this is what is happening now-a-days.
We have tried to plot the graphs for the same showning how is the scenario now and what it would have been without any social influence.
